            <li>150ml sunflower oil, plus extra for the tin</li>
            <li>175g self-raising flour</li>

            <li>2 tbsp golden syrup</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>150ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
          </ul>
          <li>For the icing
            <ul>
              <li>100g unsalted butter</li>
              <li>225g icing sugar</li>
              <li>40g cocoa powder</li>
              <li>2Â½ tbsp milk (a little more if needed)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base of two 18cm sandwich tins. Sieve the flour, cocoa powder, and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Add the caster sugar and mix well.</li>
          <li>Make a well in the center and add the golden syrup, eggs, sunflower oil, and milk. Beat well with an electric whisk until smooth.</li>
          <li>Pour the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25-30 minutes until risen and firm to the touch. Remove from the oven, leave to cool for 10 minutes before turning out onto a cooling rack.</li>
          <li>To make the icing, beat the unsalted butter in a bowl until soft. Gradually sieve and beat in the icing sugar and cocoa powder, then add enough of the milk to make the icing fluffy and spreadable.</li>
          <li>Sandwich the two cakes together with the butter icing and cover the sides and the top of the cake with more icing.</li>
        </ol>
